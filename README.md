## Frequently Asked Questions

### How accurate are the calculations?
The calculations use standard industry formulas for estimating landscaping materials. However, actual requirements may vary based on specific project conditions.

### Can I use this for commercial projects?
While the calculator provides estimates suitable for planning, professional projects should always include precise measurements from a qualified landscaper.

### Why are there different densities for different rock sizes?
Larger rocks have more air space between them, resulting in lower density per volume compared to smaller rocks.
